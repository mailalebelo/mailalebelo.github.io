Project: Landing page for “Restore Wellness” (mock client)

Challenge
- Client needed more bookings for 60-minute coaching sessions; previous page was long and unfocused.

Approach
- Lead with a concise value-driven headline.
- Use 3 benefit bullets tied to client outcomes.
- Add a short social proof line + a simple booking CTA ("Book a free 15‑min intro").

Key copy (hero)
- Headline: Reclaim calm. One session at a time.
- Subheadline: Short, practical coaching to help you move from overwhelm to small, steady change.
- CTA: Book a free 15‑minute intro

Result (mock / hypothesis)
- Conversion target: increase email signups by 30% and booked intros by 20% within 6 weeks.
- Measurement: booking tool metrics + simple thank-you page with UTM.

Notes
- This is a spec case study you can adapt into real client work. I can add screenshots and A/B variants once you have live traffic.
